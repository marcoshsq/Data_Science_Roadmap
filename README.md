## Overview/About

The **Self-taught Data Science Curriculum** is a learning guide I developed to master data science concepts and skills for free. Upon realizing the vast amount of high-quality, free resources available online, I decided to compile and organize them into a coherent roadmap. This project is not only my personal journey into data science but also a guide for anyone who wishes to follow a similar path.

Initially, this curriculum was designed for my own learning, but you are welcome to clone it and explore the courses if they align with your goals. The material here covers a broad range of topics essential for a successful data science career, from programming to artificial intelligence. The sources I used can be found in the "References" section at the end of the README.

## Learning Goals

The main objective is to follow a structured learning path inspired by the roadmap from the AI Expert team. The key skills and concepts I aim to master by the end of this curriculum include:

### 1. **Proficiency in Programming**
   - **Python**: The primary language for data manipulation, machine learning, and AI model development. Python will be heavily explored due to its versatility and wide adoption in data science.
   - **R**: A powerful language for statistical analysis, data visualization, and in-depth exploration of statistical data.
     
### 2. **Databases, Big Data, and Data Warehousing**
   - **Databases**: Focus on both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) database systems for effective data management and retrieval.
   - **Data Warehousing**: Understanding the design and implementation of data warehouses for efficient storage and management of large datasets.

### 3. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**
   - **Machine Learning**: Learn how to build and apply machine learning models for tasks such as predictive analytics, classification, and pattern recognition.
   - **Deep Learning**: Dive into neural networks, with an emphasis on frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, to explore architectures and advanced AI techniques.

## How to Use This Curriculum

This curriculum is broken down into various modules that align with the core areas of data science. You can follow them sequentially or skip to specific areas based on your current knowledge and interests. I encourage you to adapt this guide to your own learning style, pace, and goals.

## References

The "References" section at the end of this repository contains a comprehensive list of resources that I consulted while building this guide, including free online courses, tutorials, and learning platforms.

## Notes and Clarifications

* The duration of the courses listed here are estimates provided by the platforms where they are offered.

* At the moment, I am working on this graduation, so the tense of this `readme` is a bit strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future. As I work on it, I will reformat it to better reflect my experience.

* Regarding the books, my university has partnerships with some platforms like O'Reilly, in addition to a very large library where I managed to find almost all of them. But if you don't have access... ahem... try to see if they fall off the truck... ahem... but if you can buy them, please do.
